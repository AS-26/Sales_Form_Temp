# Sales_Form_Temp
This is a hibernate small scale project. It contains a java bean for input form for the sales team. Then HTML and CSS for the basic frontend. 
The main purpose of this project was to revise my hibernate connection skills (hehe).
This has the potential to grow as I can easily add the CRUD operations in it. In upcoming days I will do it. If someone is cloning this before the upgrade you can add these operations on your own too, it's easy. :)
